# ðŸŒŠÂ Quest 2 - Set Sail with Solana Programs

ðŸ“˜Â Solana programs scale really well with large data sets, since they can execute in parallel on varying slices of the blockchainâ€™s data.
Thatâ€™s how one single program is able to manage our map of the high seas!

You're going to learn how to write a program that can manage a player's position and how to save and distribute SOL and SPL tokens from within a program. We will also learn how to do a local setup for an Anchor program and a Next.js client.
